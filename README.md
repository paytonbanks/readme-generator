<br>
    
### Instructions:
1. From the project's root directory, open a intergraged terminal and run: [npm init](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) next a package.json file will be created in the project folder.
 
2. Within the package.json file, confirm that the *inquier desendencies* were installed, if not run: [npminstall inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) in the same root directory as the init.

3. Once inquirer is installed run the final command: [npm install](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-install). If there are not notifications of known "errors" the the installation is not complete until the terminal command line has returned to the root folder.
